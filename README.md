# PyScan3D
Uses data gathered from the Structure Sensor by Occipital to classify things into their respective shapes. 
Python is required to be able to run this program.

## Features:
**Mail Parser** - Log in to your email to select and download scans <br>
**Object Classifier** - Load a .obj or .ply file to classify its shape


## Known Application Bugs
- Histogram is slow to load due to tkinter limitations
- Mail parser does not show the correct errors
- If show model window is open, the main GUI window will not update until the show model window is closed
- If show model window is open,  application will not classify properly
- When the classify button is repeatedly pressed multiple times, the application will become not responding
- When classifying is processing and user clicks any button before processing is complete will cause the program to not function properly
- Prone to crash when histogram and show model window are open at the same time
- When logged into mail parser, if you leave screen or close application an error will show

## Installation:

### Install Python
Refer to the [Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to properly configure and install Python. \
For our program, we used Python 3.6. 

### Install Git
Dowload Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will need this to clone the GitHub repository.

In a terminal window, cd to a location you want to save the repository to. Then run one of the following commands:

### Clone the repository using HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/emilieez/pyscan.git
```

### Clone the repository using SSH:

```
git clone git@github.com:emilieez/pyscan.git
```

### Installing Dependencies
A [virtual environment](#Run-the-PyScan-virtual-environment) is provided if the dependencies are not installed.
However, all dependencies can be installed using this command in the root folder of the repository:
#### Windows
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Linux/MacOS
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the PyScan virtual environment
A virtual environment is provided if the dependencies are not installed. This will allow you to use all of the 
libraries needed without having to install it on your computer. Keep the environment
active as long as you are running the application.
### Windows:

Run the following line in Command Prompt:
```
PyScan\Scripts\activate
```

The terminal should now look something like this:
```
(PyScan) D:\pyscan>
```
Proceed to: [Running the PyScan3D Application](#Running-the-PyScan3D-Application).

### Linux or MacOS: 

Run the following line in the terminal:
```
source /PyScan/bin/activate
```

The terminal should now look something like this:
```
(PyScan) root@localhost:~/pyscan$
```
Proceed to: [Running the PyScan3D Application](#Running-the-PyScan3D-Application).

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment
If you no longer want to run the application, you will also need to deactivate the virtual environment.<br>
To deactivate the virtual environment on Windows, simply type:
```
PyScan\Scripts\deactivate
```
or on Linux/MacOS:
```
deactivate
```

## Running the PyScan3D Application
In the root folder of the repository type:
```
python pyscan.py
```

## Troubleshooting


### 1.) The system cannot find the path specified.
Ensure you are in the root folder. This is the main folder that houses all the files. 
If you cloned from GitHub, the root/main folder is called pyscan.

### 2.) Missing Dependencies
Install a dependency using this command:

#### Windows
```
pip install <dependency name>
```

#### Linux/MacOS
```
pip3 install <dependency name>
```

Alternatively, all dependencies can be reinstalled: [Installing Dependencies](#Installing-Dependencies)
